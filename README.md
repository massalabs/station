### Modules (plugins)

MassaStation is a module manager. It enables everyone to use, create and enjoy different modules to activate features to the Massa blockchain.

#### Install a module

You can install modules that were validated by Massa Labs from the [Module Store](https://station.massa/web/store).

The module will be automatically installed and activated after a few seconds directly in your Station. Browse MassaStation store to find the module you need.

#### Create a module

If you are working on a module, you can install it manually to test it using MassaStation:

1. Get the `.zip` file download URL of the module you want to install. Make sure this URL matches the version of MassaStation you are using, your computer OS and architecture.
2. Paste the URL in the `Install a plugin` field of the [module manager page](https://station.massa/web/store).
3. Click on the `Install` button.

> **Note:** A complete guide on how to create a module will be available soon.
