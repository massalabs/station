# Massa Community Charter and DeWeb terms of use

Code for open collaboration and truly decentralized blockchain

## 1. Introduction and scope

This charter (the “Charter”) serves as the social contract that governs the conduct and responsibilities of all members of the Massa community (the “Massa Community”) when interacting with the Massa layer-1 blockchain (the “Massa Blockchain”) and the Massa network (the “Massa Network”). This Charter aims to reflect the values of openness, transparency, and decentralization.

For the purposes of this Charter, a “Member” is defined as any individual, entity, or group that:

* operates or hosts a Massa node, contributing to network security, decentralization, and consensus;
* participates in block creation and validation within the Massa Blockchain;
* uses, modifies, or interacts with Massa’s open-source software, which is made available under its respective license and requires compliance with this Charter; or
* engages with systems and applications deployed on the Massa Blockchain.

## 2. Acceptance

Operating a node, using the Massa Blockchain’s systems, or interacting with any software implementing the Massa protocol means accepting and adhering to this Massa Community Charter. By using, modifying, or interacting with Massa’s open-source software or any system built on the Massa Blockchain, you automatically become a Member of the Massa Community and agree to comply with this Charter.

As a Member, you are expected to read, accept, and follow its terms, while also encouraging others in the community to do the same.

Your continued participation in the Massa Network signifies your ongoing agreement to uphold these principles and contribute to a transparent, traceable, and secure ecosystem.

If you do not accept these terms, you should immediately discontinue all activities within the Massa Network.

## 3. Key principles: transparency, traceability and integrity

The Massa Network, in all its current and future configurations, development, deployment, and use, must uphold and prioritize three fundamental principles at all times: (1) transparency, (2) traceability, and (3) integrity. These principles are essential to maintaining trust, accountability, and fairness within the Massa Community.

(1) Transparency is a fundamental requirement for monitoring participatory processes and mechanisms. However, it shall never be applied in a manner that compromises personal data protection or infringes upon the privacy of Massa participants.

(2) Traceability guarantees full accountability for past participatory and decision-making processes within the Massa Community while ensuring the same standards for present and future interactions. Each Member must act in their own name or explicitly disclose when acting on behalf of another Massa user or Member.

(3) Integrity ensures the authenticity and legitimacy of operations, votes, and decision-making processes, preventing any form of manipulation that could compromise the blockchain or distort the results of participatory mechanisms.

## 4. Decentralization Policy

TO SAFEGUARD THE DECENTRALIZED NATURE OF THE MASSA BLOCKCHAIN, ALL MEMBERS HEREBY COMMIT TO AVOIDING ANY ACTIONS THAT MAY LEAD TO THE CONCENTRATION OF STAKING POWER AMONG A LIMITED NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS. MEMBERS AGREE NOT TO OPERATE AS PROFESSIONAL DELEGATORS WITHIN THE MASSA COMMUNITY.

A professional delegator refers to a person or an entity whose activity, whether principal or accessory, is to receive tokens from other members to stake them on their behalf. A Member will be deemed a professional delegator if they receive or manage a total of 1,000,000 MAS tokens or more through delegation or direct transmission on behalf of strictly more than one person or entity.

For the avoidance of doubt, listing MAS tokens on exchange platforms is permitted, as are all other exchange-related activities, including but not limited to receiving, managing, and trading cryptocurrencies across blockchain networks or facilitating market liquidity and token accessibility. However, any staking activity involving MAS tokens, including through third-parties, is restricted as pert the limits set forth in this Massa Community Charter.

## 5. Prohibition of delegation by any means

In line with the Decentralization Policy described in section 4, any form of delegation, transfer, or management of MAS tokens to a Member or third-party acting on behalf of a Member, where the total delegated or transferred amount meets or exceeds 1,000,000 MAS tokens (the “Delegation Threshold”), shall be considered a breach of this Charter. Members of the Massa Community are strictly prohibited from engaging in any form of delegation, transfer, or management of MAS tokens—whether as a staking participant or a professional delegator —resulting in exceeding the Delegation Threshold.

The Massa Community strictly prohibits any attempt to bypass the delegation restrictions through indirect or concealed means. Members commit to refraining from any actions that would violate this prohibition and specifically undertake not to engage in, including but not limited to, the following actions:

* operate multiple validator nodes or establish multiple staking entities under different identities to circumvent the Delegation Threshold;
* accept, manage, or stake MAS tokens on behalf of third parties beyond the specified Delegation Threshold;
* operate a staking delegation pool or other similar mechanisms that facilitate delegation beyond the Delegation Threshold;
* run validator nodes or stake MAS tokens on behalf of another entity or individual;
* establish corporate structures or proxy entities to circumvent the Delegation Threshold.

Violations of this prohibition shall result in enforcement actions, which may include but are not limited to:

1. blacklisting of the public addresses used to exceed the Delegation Threshold;
2. contractual penalties as described under section 10;
3. legal action, including but not limited to contractual enforcement and potential civil claims for damages caused to the network.

## 6. Accountability

All Members of the Massa Community are expected to adhere to the principles outlined in this Charter, and to ensure they do not undermine other Members or even the decentralization of the Massa Blockchain. The provisions of this Charter carry full contractual force and are binding on all Members. Any violation of these provisions may result in accountability and potential sanctions, as outlined in the enforcement measures detailed in section 10.

Engaging in activities that disrupt the integrity, security or functionality of the Massa Network, such as spamming, spreading misinformation, conducting unauthorized transactions, or using the platform to carry out any illegal activities, including but not limited to money laundering, terrorist financing, bypassing international sanctions, or the purchase or sale of illegal goods, is strictly prohibited.

Similarly, altering, distributing or deploying the Massa codebase in ways that violate the Massa license terms, introduce vulnerabilities, facilitate malicious activities, or contribute to illegal activities as described above is forbidden.

When publishing content using the Massa Decentralized Web or interacting with content published on the Massa Decentralized Web, Members must ensure that their contributions comply with all applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, Members should not use the Massa Decentralized Web, or any other systems provided on the Massa Blockchain, to engage in activities that could compromise network security, violate laws and regulations, or breach the system’s terms of use. Members are encouraged to act in a manner that upholds the integrity and security of the Massa Decentralized Web, and of all systems provided on the Massa Blockchain, and that complies with the principles of the Massa Community.

# Terms of Use MASSA DECENTRALIZED WEB

Date: March 21st, 2025

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Massa Decentralized Web (the “Massa Decentralized Web” or the “Massa DeWeb”), a fully decentralized on-chain web ecosystem provided on the Massa blockchain (the “Massa Blockchain”).

The underlying technology of Massa DeWeb (the “Protocol”) was initially developed by Massa Labs, a company incorporated under French law (“Massa Labs”, “we”, “us”, or “Us”), and supported by Massa Foundation, a foundation incorporated under Swiss law (“Massa Foundation”). Following its launch, Massa DeWeb operates in a fully decentralized manner, free from intermediaries of any central authority exercising control over the infrastructure.

The Massa DeWeb allows developers to build and host their projects directly on the Massa Blockchain. This unique approach mitigates the risks of censorship and hacking, providing a seamless Web 3 experience for users.

Developers can register ".massa" domains using Massa Name System (the “Massa Name System”, “MNS”), a decentralized, blockchain-based naming protocol, and build and host both front-end and back-end components of their websites or decentralized applications (“Dapps”) directly on the Massa Blockchain (“Decentralized Web Hosting”).  

These terms of use (together with all appendices and exhibits hereto, which are hereby incorporated by reference, these “Terms,” or this “Agreement”) explain the terms and conditions by which You, as a user (“User(s)”), either personally or on behalf of an entity (“you” or “You”), may access and use the Massa DeWeb Protocol and the on-chain systems provided within its fully decentralized ecosystem.

## 2. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing, using, or otherwise interacting with Massa DeWeb in any manner, including but not limited to accessing it through your local server or utilizing any features and systems available via the website-hosted user interface provided by Massa DeWeb Providers, You acknowledge that you have read, understood, and fully accepted these Terms. Your use of Massa DeWeb constitutes your acceptance of these Terms and agreement to comply with the decentralized rules governing its use.

If you do not agree to these Terms, You are not authorized to access or use Massa DeWeb and must refrain from doing so.

## 3. Definitions

The definitions provided in Appendix A of these Terms apply to all capitalized terms used herein.

## 4. The Massa DeWeb and its on-chain systems

### 4.1 The Massa DeWeb

The purpose of the Massa DeWeb is to create an on-chain, fully decentralized, web ecosystem, addressing security and reliability concerns associated with centralized servers. By storing all websites on-chain, the risks associated with centralized servers, such as single points of failure and vulnerability to hacks, are eliminated. This approach enhances security, ensuring that websites are resilient against censorship and attacks, and provides true freedom and accessibility to everyone.

The Massa DeWeb allows developers to build and host their projects directly on the Massa Blockchain, using MNS to register “.massa” domains on-chain and the Decentralized Web Hosting protocol for uploading the front-end of their applications or websites on the Massa Blockchain.

### 4.2 The MNS Protocol

The MNS available on the Massa DeWeb is a decentralized blockchain-based naming protocol which enables Users to register “.massa” domain name(s) (the “Massa Name(s)”) on the decentralized domain name system (“DNS”) on Massa Blockchain, creating unique, recognizable web addresses.

The MNS operates as a decentralized system and is not governed by or affiliated with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). MNS does not function as a traditional domain name registry and should not be construed as such.

Massa Names are on-chain, fully replicated, and immutable NFTs that Users can mint for unique domain names.

### 4.3 The Decentralized Web Hosting Protocol

Decentralized Web Hosting enables Users to design and host their applications or websites’s front-end using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and other familiar web technologies, eliminating the need for third-party hosting services.

Users may manage their website development on the Massa Blockchain and upload their content by using the command-line tool made available in the Massa Documentation, such as at this URL https://docs.massa.net/docs/deweb/cli/overview or via any other tool provided to Users for using the Decentralized Web Hosting system.

## 5. Eligibility

To use the Massa DeWeb You represent and warrant that You meet the following criteria:

1. Age requirement: You must be at least 18 years old or the legal age of majority in Your jurisdiction, whichever is greater, to access and use the MNS.
2. Legal capacity: You must have the legal authority and capacity to enter into binding contracts under applicable law. By registering, You confirm that You are not prohibited from using the MNS and its Protocol under the laws of their jurisdiction.
3. Jurisdictional compliance: You are responsible for ensuring that Your use of the Massa DeWeb, complies with all local laws and regulations in your jurisdiction, in Switzerland and in France. You may not use the Massa DeWeb for any illegal activities, including but not limited to activities that violate local, national, or international laws or regulations.
4. Prohibited Users: individuals or entities that are subject to sanctions or restrictions by regulatory authorities, including those appearing on international sanctions lists, are not eligible to use the Massa DeWeb.
5. Accurate information: When using the Massa DeWeb, You must use your own Massa Wallet, and provide accurate, current, and complete information.

## 6. Use of Massa DeWeb

### 6.1 Access to Massa DeWeb

To start using Massa DeWeb, Users must either operate a local DeWeb server or get access via a Massa DeWeb provider (“Provider”), which provides access to Massa DeWeb through its own domain.

Specific terms governing the hosting and access to the Massa DeWeb may vary depending on the Massa DeWeb Provider chosen by the User. However, the core rules governing the use of the Massa DeWeb are defined and enforced through smart contracts underlying the Massa DeWeb Protocol.

By interacting with a specific Massa DeWeb Provider, Users agree to any additional terms imposed by that Provider, provided such terms do not conflict with the Massa DeWeb Protocol’s rules. You are responsible for conducting your own diligence on interfaces from DeWeb Providers enabling You to access to the DeWeb and its systems, and to understand the fees and risks that they might present.

### 6.2. Massa Name System

#### 6.2.1. Registration

Users may select their desired Massa Name in the registration section of the MNS interface, made available on https://mns.massa.network/. If the name is available, Users can register it by completing the registration process and paying the required fee in MAS Tokens, as outlined in Section 6.2.2.

Users are solely responsible for choosing and verifying the availability of their desired Massa Name during the registration process. The decentralized nature of the MNS protocol ensures that all registration operations are executed transparently on the Massa Blockchain, but it does not involve direct oversight or control over individual User decisions.

Once registered, Massa Names are recorded immutably in the Massa Blockchain.

By registering a Massa Name, Users acknowledge and agree that their Massa Name is unique, represented as an NFT recorded on the Massa Blockchain. Ownership and management of this NFT are fully dependent on the security and operability of their Massa Wallet.

#### 6.2.2. Registration fees

The registration fee for a Massa Name is determined by the length of the name:

* 10,000 MAS Tokens for a 2-character Massa Name;
* 1,000 MAS Tokens for a 3-character Massa Name;
* 100 MAS Tokens for a 4-character Massa Name;
* 10 MAS Tokens for a 5-character Massa Name;
* 1 MAS Token for Massa Names of 6 or more characters.

To complete the registration, Users must use their connected Massa Wallet to pay the required fee in MAS Tokens, as well as any other applicable fees or taxes.

Users are solely responsible for any blockchain network fees (e.g., gas fees) incurred during transactions on the Massa Blockchain, including those related to Massa Name registration, transfers, or updates. These fees will be calculated by the Protocol and the blockchain nodes and clearly displayed to the User before confirming the transaction.

#### 6.2.3. Duration of Massa Name Registration

Massa Names are registered for an unlimited period of time upon purchase.

Once a Massa Name is successfully registered, it is permanently recorded on the Massa Blockchain. Ownership of the Massa Name remains tied to the User’s Massa Wallet and remains with the User until it is explicitly transferred to another party, as described in section 6.2.5 below.

Neither Massa Labs, nor the Massa Foundation can remove or alter a Massa Name once it has been registered. The decentralized nature of the Protocol ensures that all registrations are immutable and securely recorded on the blockchain.

However, Massa DeWeb Providers may implement whitelisting/blacklisting mechanisms to manage access to specific Massa Names within their services. Such whitelisting/blacklisting is solely at the discretion of the respective Massa DeWeb Providers and is not managed or enforced by Massa Labs or the Massa Foundation.

#### 6.2.4. Finality of Sales

All purchases made through MNS are final and non-refundable.

However, Users may choose to release their Massa Name by using the “trash” icon in the management section of the MNS interface. The Massa Name may be burnt, or the User may choose to release its Massa Name to the Protocol, and thus receiving a refund of 50% of the MAS Tokens originally paid for the registration.

#### 6.2.5. Transferring Massa Names

Massa Names are represented as unique NFTs on the Massa Blockchain. As the owner, You may transfer Your Massa Name to another Massa Wallet through the appropriate functions provided by the Protocol. The transfer will be recorded immutably on the blockchain.

Once a Massa Name is transferred, all rights and responsibilities associated with it are also transferred to the recipient. The previous owner will no longer have control or authority over the Massa Name or any associated content.

#### 6.2.6. Changing the target address

Massa Name owners may update the address their domain name link to by using the management tools provided in the MNS interface. This allows owners to change the target of their Massa Name to a new decentralized website hosted on Massa DeWeb.

All changes to the target address are executed on the Massa Blockchain.

### 6.3. Decentralized Web Hosting Protocol

#### 6.3.1. Uploading content

To deploy a website or a DApp on the Massa Blockchain, Users may use the Massa DeWeb command-line tool (CLI).

Before uploading, Users must ensure the following: (a) they have a Massa Wallet to verify ownership of the website; (b) they have the Massa node URL intended for processing the upload; and (c) the website or DApp files are stored in a local directory and comply with the requirements specified in the Massa DeWeb CLI.

#### 6.3.2. Access to the website or DApp

To be able to access your website or DApp, You need to associate it with a Massa domain, meaning that a Massa Name needs to be assigned to your website to link your deployed website address to a custom Massa domain.  

#### 6.3.3. Fees

A one-time storage fee is required to use the Protocol. This fee will be based on the size of the website/DApp files, calculated at a fixed rate of 0.0001 MAS per byte stored. A minimum of 0.001 MAS is required to create new storage entry. Users must lock the corresponding amount of MAS coins to store their website files, and these tokens remain locked for as long as the storage is in use. The storage fee and related protocol parameters may evolve over time, subject to changes introduced through governance decisions or Protocol upgrades.

If a User deletes stored content, the corresponding locked coins are refunded to their balance. Expanding a website or adding new files requires additional storage fees, calculated based on the increased file size. Massa DeWeb does not impose monthly fees or bandwidth charges, ensuring that Users only pay for the storage they use when uploading or updating files.

Users are solely responsible for any blockchain network fees (e.g., gas fees) incurred during transactions on the Massa Blockchain, including those related to uploads, updates, or deletion of content by Users. These fees will be calculated by the Protocol and the blockchain nodes and clearly displayed to the User before confirming the transaction.

### 6.4. Responsibility and security

USERS BEAR FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MASSA NAME THEY REGISTER AND THE CONTENT THEY UPLOAD ON MASSA DEWEB. YOU MUST ENSURE THAT YOUR CHOSEN MASSA NAME AND ALL HOSTED CONTENT ADHERE TO APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THIS OBLIGATION ALSO COVERS ANY ACTIVITIES OR MATERIALS ACCESSIBLE THROUGH THE DOMAIN ASSOCIATED WITH THE MASSA NAME.

THE MASSA DEWEB PROTOCOL OPERATES AS NEUTRAL, DECENTRALIZED INFRASTRUCTURE POWERED BY DECENTRALIZED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY. DUE TO MASSA DEWEB FULLY DECENTRALIZED NATURE, NEITHER MASSA LABS, NOR THE MASSA FOUNDATION HAS CONTROL OVER OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE LEGALITY, APPROPRIATENESS, OR CONSEQUENCES OF USERS' SELECTED MASSA NAMES OR ANY CONTENT UPLOADED ON THEIR WEBSITES OR APPLICATIONS HOSTED ON THE MASSA DEWEB, OR ACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM.

BY USING THE MASSA DEWEB PROTOCOL, USERS ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THEY BEAR FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR CHOICES AND ACTIONS AND THAT NO CENTRALIZED ENTITY OR OPERATOR IS AVAILABLE TO INTERVENE OR REMEDY ISSUES ARISING FROM THEIR USE. USERS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ALL CONTENT UPLOADED AND ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR MASSA NAME MUST COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. MASSA LABS AND THE MASSA FOUNDATION DISCLAIM ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE LEGALITY, APPROPRIATENESS, OR QUALITY OF THE CONTENT UPLOADED BY USERS.

TO ACCESS AND USE THE MASSA WEB PROTOCOL, USERS MUST CONNECT THEIR MASSA WALLET. USERS ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR SECURING THEIR MASSA WALLET CREDENTIALS AND PRIVATE KEYS. THE LOSS OR COMPROMISE OF WALLET CREDENTIALS MAY RESULT IN THE IRREVERSIBLE LOSS OF ACCESS TO THE REGISTERED MASSA NAME, ASSOCIATED NFTS, WEBSITE CONTENT, AND OTHER FUNCTIONALITIES.

THE MASSA COMMUNITY MEMBERS, MASSA LABS, AND THE MASSA FOUNDATION DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY FOR ANY LOSS OF ACCESS, OWNERSHIP, OR CONTROL OVER MASSA NAMES CAUSED BY THE COMPROMISE, MISUSE, OR LOSS OF WALLET CREDENTIALS. USERS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NO RECOVERY OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES.

## 12. Force Majeure

Massa Labs, Massa Foundation, and the decentralized community of node runners responsible for maintaining the Massa Blockchain and Massa DeWeb, shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performing their respective obligations under these Terms, nor for any loss, damage, or inconvenience suffered by the User, due to circumstances beyond their reasonable control. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, acts of war, threats of war, riots, civil strife, terrorist activity, industrial disputes, natural disasters, nuclear disasters or explosions, fires, severe weather conditions, epidemics or pandemics (including those impacting employees or contractors responsible for service operations), interruptions or failures of utility services (including electricity or internet outages), acts of local or national governments (including the imposition of economic sanctions), and cyber incidents such as cyber-terrorism, cyberattacks, hacking, bugs, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, or other events materially affecting the functionality or operation of the MNS protocol or the blockchain on which it operates.

This clause applies when events beyond anyone’s control significantly disrupt the ability of Massa Labs, Massa Foundation, or the decentralized node runners maintaining the Massa DeWeb Protocol to function or operate as intended. Even if reasonable precautions and alternative measures are taken, certain disruptions may be unavoidable. Users acknowledge that because the Protocol is decentralized, Massa Labs and Massa Foundation have no control over its operation and cannot intervene to fix or prevent disruptions caused by Force Majeure events.

## 13. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Massa Labs, Massa Foundation, and the decentralized community of node runners responsible for maintaining the Massa Blockchain and Massa DeWeb, their affiliates, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, contractors, licensors, and service providers (collectively the “Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising from or related to:

a. Your access to or use of the Massa DeWeb, or any related systems, including any misuse or unauthorized use of the Protocol or associated interfaces;
b. Your breach or alleged breach of these Terms or any applicable agreements, policies or guidelines governing your interaction with the Massa DeWeb Protocol, or related systems;
c. Your violation of any applicable laws, regulations, or orders of governmental or regulatory authorities in connection with your use of the Massa DeWeb, or related systems; and
d. any claims by third parties alleging that your actions, conduct, or content (including your selected Massa Name, and uploaded content) infringe upon their rights, including but not limited to intellectual property rights, trademarks, privacy rights, or any other proprietary or personal rights;
e. any claims, losses, or liabilities arising from your use of or interaction with the decentralized aspects of the Protocol, including but not limited to the operation of smart contracts, blockchain transactions, or interactions with third-party providers or services.

You agree to cooperate fully with the Indemnified Parties in the defense of any claim. Massa Labs and the Massa Foundation reserve the right, at their sole discretion, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by You. You shall not, in any event, settle any claim without the prior written consent of Massa Labs or the Massa Foundation.

Your indemnification obligations shall survive the termination of these Terms and your cessation of use of the Massa DeWeb, or any related systems.

## 14. Changes to Terms

These Terms of Use govern the Massa DeWeb Protocol as it exists at the time of their release and cannot be modified or updated thereafter. Following the launch of Massa DeWeb, the Protocol functions as a fully decentralized web ecosystem, without intermediaries or central authority. As a result, these Terms remain applicable only to the version of the Protocol available at the time of their publication and will be stored within the Massa DeWeb Protocol for reference.

Due to its decentralized nature, the Massa DeWeb Protocol may evolve over time as the Massa Community deploys new smart contracts or implements technical upgrades. In such instances, a new version of the Protocol may be introduced by the Community, accompanied by a new version of the Terms of Use. Once a new version of the Massa DeWeb Protocol is pushed, the previous Terms may become obsolete as the Protocol transitions to its latest iteration.

Users acknowledge and agree that, to the extent permitted by law, any new version of the Terms of Use will take effect immediately upon publication, unless explicitly stated otherwise. The latest version of the Terms of Use will supersede all prior versions, rendering previous terms legally ineffective unless otherwise specified. USERS BEAR FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR STAYING INFORMED ABOUT PROTOCOL UPDATES AND UNDERSTANDING HOW THESE CHANGES MAY IMPACT THEIR USE OF THE MASSA DEWEB ECOSYSTEM.

BY CONTINUING TO USE THE MASSA DEWEB PROTOCOL, USERS ACCEPT THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PROTOCOL UPGRADES AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MASSA LABS, MASSA FOUNDATION, AND ANY AFFILIATED PARTIES DO NOT CONTROL THE GOVERNANCE, UPDATES, OR MAINTENANCE OF THE PROTOCOL. USERS MUST REGULARLY REVIEW THE MASSA DEWEB DOCUMENTATION TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE LATEST TERMS OF USE AND TAKE ALL NECESSARY STEPS TO PROTECT THEIR CONTENT, MASSA NAMES, AND OTHER ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROTOCOL.

## 15. Termination

Users may discontinue their use of the Massa DeWeb Protocol at any time. However, due to the decentralized and immutable nature of the Massa Blockchain, Massa Labs, Massa Foundation, or any other party cannot delete or reverse prior transactions, registrations, or uploaded content. Users acknowledge that terminating their use of the Protocol does not remove any Massa Name, website content, or other recorded activity from the Massa Blockchain.

AS THE MASSA DEWEB PROTOCOL EVOLVES, THE DECENTRALIZED COMMUNITY OF NODE RUNNERS MAINTAINING THE MASSA BLOCKCHAIN MAY PUSH A NEW VERSION OF THE PROTOCOL. IF THIS OCCURS, USERS WHO CHOOSE NOT TO TRANSITION TO THE UPDATED VERSION MAY EXPERIENCE LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY, INCOMPATIBILITY, OR AN INABILITY TO INTERACT WITH THE LATEST PROTOCOL VERSION. MASSA LABS AND MASSA FOUNDATION DO NOT CONTROL OR ENFORCE SUCH CHANGES AND BEAR NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING DISRUPTIONS.

Additionally, while the Massa DeWeb Protocol itself is neutral, individual Massa DeWeb Providers may establish their own terms and conditions. Users acknowledge that providers may refuse to host certain content or restrict access to specific Massa Names based on their own policies. Such actions are solely at the discretion of the respective Provider and do not constitute enforcement by Massa Labs or Massa Foundation.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Massa Labs, Massa Foundation, and any parties involved in the development, deployment, or support of Massa DeWeb shall not be liable for any losses, damages, or consequences arising from a User's voluntary termination, Protocol updates, DeWeb Provider decisions, or inability to access their assets due to private key loss or security breaches.

The provisions of these Terms that, by their nature, are intended to survive termination shall remain in full force and effect. This includes, but is not limited to, provisions related to indemnification, limitation of liability, governing law, dispute resolution, intellectual property rights, and any other clauses necessary to protect the rights and obligations of the parties.

## 16. Miscellaneous / General Provisions

## 16.1. Entire agreement

These Terms, constitute the entire agreement between the parties regarding the Massa DeWeb Protocol, superseding all prior agreements, representations, and understandings related to the subject matter.

## 16.2. Salvage Clause

If a court or competent jurisdiction finds that any provision of these Terms is illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

## 16.3. No waiver

The failure or delay of Massa Labs, the Massa Foundation, or the decentralized community of node runners maintaining the Massa Blockchain to enforce any provision of these Terms shall not be deemed a waiver of their right to do so in the future with respect to that provision, any other provision, or these Terms as a whole.

## 16.4. Assignment

You shall not assign any of your rights and obligations under these Terms. Any such attempt at assignment by You shall be void.

Massa Labs, the Massa Foundation, or the decentralized community of node runners maintaining the Massa Blockchain may assign their rights, and obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, at their sole discretion and without limitation.

## 16.5. English Version

If there is an inconsistency between any of the provisions of this English language version and a translated version of these Terms, the provisions of this English language version shall prevail. Any translated versions shall be for convenience only.

## 16.6. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed by the laws of Switzerland, to the exclusion of any rules of conflict of laws.

## 16.7. Dispute resolution

In the event of a dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms, the parties agree to refer the dispute to arbitration in accordance with the Swiss Rules of International Arbitration of the Swiss Arbitration Centre. The arbitral tribunal shall consist of one (1) arbitrator, the seat of arbitration shall be Geneva, Switzerland, and the language of arbitration shall be English. This arbitration agreement shall be governed by the laws of Switzerland.

Nothing in this clause prevents either party from seeking urgent provisional or interlocutory relief from a competent court or an equivalent decentralized mechanism to prevent irreparable harm pending final resolution of the dispute.
