Thank you for considering contributing to Thyra! We welcome contributions from the community and value the time and effort you put into making this project better.

## Getting Started

To contribute to Thyra, you should have a basic understanding of the Go programming language and Git version control system. If you're new to Go, we recommend checking out [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1) to get started.

Before you can start contributing, you'll need to complete the following steps:
- Install the dependencies:
  - Ubuntu like:
```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install -y build-essential libgl1-mesa-dev xorg-dev p7zip
```
- Install Node.js and NPM:

    - Windows:
        - Download the Node.js installer from https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
        - Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Node.js and NPM.

    - macOS:

        - Install Homebrew by following the instructions at https://brew.sh/.

        - Run the following command to install Node.js and NPM:
        ```bash
        brew install node
        ```
    - Ubuntu:
        - Run the following command to update the package lists:

        - Run the following command to install Node.js and NPM:
        ```bash
        sudo apt install nodejs npm
        ```

- Install Go: Go is required to build and run Thyra. You can install Go by following the instructions at [https://go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install).

- Install Swagger: Thyra uses Swagger to generate code from the API documentation. You can install Swagger by running the following command:

```bash
go install github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/cmd/swagger@latest
```
- Install Stringer: it genreates declarations for enum types. You can install Stringer by running the following command:
```bash 
go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer@latest
```

You can find more information about Swagger at [https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger).

- Build generated files: Thyra generates code using Stringer and Go Swagger. You can build all generated files by running the following command:

```bash 
go generate ./...
```

- Build from source: Once you've completed the above steps, you can build Thyra from source by running the following commands:

```bash
go build -o thyra-server cmd/thyra-server/main.go
```

> **_NOTE:_** On Linux, you can add the possibility to bind to a port lower than 1024 without the program being executed as root by doing `sudo setcap CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE=+eip thyra-server`

- Run Thyra: you can finaly launch thyra by executing `thyra-server` binary.

## Code Formatting

We take code formatting seriously in Thyra to maintain a consistent code style. Please follow these guidelines to ensure that your code is properly formatted:


### golangci-lint

We use `golangci-lint` to run linters in parallel. We recommend installing it locally and running it on your source code before pushing any modifications, otherwise some potential lint errors will be caught by the CI pipeline.

To run `golangci-lint` locally:
```bash 
golangci-lint run ./...
```
#### How to resolve golangci-lint recurring errors ?

- File is not `gofumpt`

gofumpt need to be installed locally `go install mvdan.cc/gofumpt@latest`

run gofumpt locally on your source code `gofumpt -l -w ./...`

- File is not `gci`

gci need to be installed locally `go install github.com/daixiang0/gci@latest`

run gci locally on your source code `gci --write ./...`
