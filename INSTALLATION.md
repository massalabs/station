## Introduction

From this point you'll start to custom your Massa's journey thanks to Thyra. If you want to learn more about Thyra's objectives and mindset, go here; if you're curious about the technical aspects and want to contribute go [there](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

This document will guide you through the installation process and the first steps to get started with Thyra.


> **_TROUBLESHOOTING:_** If you have trouble following this procedure, feel free to [open a question](https://github.com/massalabs/thyra/issues/new) describing your problem.

## Instructions by Devices

By following these instructions, you will: 
* Install Thyra to access and perform actions on the blockchain. 
* Install Thyra application to interact and use Thyra and its plugins very easily.

### Desktop

#### MacOS

1. Check out your Mac CPU to know which link above you should use.
* If you have an Apple Silicon CPU (M1, M2, ...), download ARM installer [here](https://github.com/massalabs/thyra/releases/download/v0.1.12/thyra-installer_darwin_arm64.tar.gz)
* If you have an Intel CPU (i5, i7, ...), download ADM installer [here](https://github.com/massalabs/thyra/releases/download/v0.1.12/thyra-installer_darwin_amd64.tar.gz)
2. Once downloaded, double clik on the file
> **_NOTE:_** You may need to authorise the download of this file as your Mac won't recognise it. You can authorise the installer to run by right clicking on the installer and click on `Open` from Finder. A dialog box will open asking you if you are sure, press the `Open` button and the installer should start.
3. A terminal should open automatically where you can follow the steps of the installation. Just watch it working, and at some point you'll need to add your password.
* Why do you need to enter your password? Simply because Thyra is an application and to add this application to your Mac you need to validate that you wish to install this app; like you do for app from the app store. 
4. Once the installation is finished, you will see a new icon on the top nav bar (see screenshot below). You can now close your terminal (if not done already) and start browsing the blockchain and all our applications available.

> **_NOTE:_** If you quit Thyra, the icon tray will disappear. Normal! If you want to add it back, open your finder and look for "thyra" in all your mac. You should see the following file "XXXX"; click on it and the app will be back on your top nav bar.
