## Introduction

This document will guide you through the installation process of the latest tagged version of Thyra.

> **_PREREQUISITES:_** Be comfortable with your terminal and have a recent version of MacOS, Windows or Linux.

> **_TROUBLESHOOTING:_** If you have trouble following this procedure, feel free to [open a question](https://github.com/massalabs/thyra/issues/new) describing your problem.

## Step by step instructions

Two steps are required to use our web on-chain product:

* Thyra installation : obtain the Thyra binary corresponding to your operating system (OS), rename it and make it executable.
* DNS configuration : install and configure your DNS to resolve the massa top level domain (*.massa) where Thyra runs.

The following installation guide allows you to perform these steps automatically using a simple script to run on your terminal.

Now, let's move on to your OS section:

* [Linux](#linux)
* [Windows](#windows)
* [MacOS](#macos)
