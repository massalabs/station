> **_TROUBLESHOOTING:_** If you have trouble following this procedure, feel free to [open a question](https://github.com/massalabs/thyra/issues/new) describing your problem.

## Instruction by Devices

By following these instructions, you will: 
* Install Thyra to access and perform actions on the blockchain. 
* Install Thyra application to interact and use Thyra and its plugins very easily.

### Desktop


#### MacOS
Before installing Thyra, make sure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can verify this by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
node -v && npm -v
```
If you do not have Node.js and npm installed, you can download them from the official [website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

1. Go on [this page](https://.com/massalabs/thyra/releases/latest) and download the installer that corresponds to your MacOS configuration
* If you have M1 chip or more, chose "thyra-installer_darwin_arm64" installer 
* Otherwise, chose "thyra-installer_darwin_amd64" installer
2. Once downloaded, double clik on the file 
> **_NOTE:_** You may need to authorise the download of this file as your Mac won't recognise it.
3. A terminal should open automatically where you can follow the steps of the installation. Just watch it working, and at some point you'll need to add your password.
* Why do you need to enter your password? Simply because Thyra is an application and to add this application to your Mac you need to validate that you wish to install this app; like you do from the app store. 
4. Once the installation is finished, you will see a new icon on the top nav bar (see screenshot below). You can now close your terminal if not done already and start browsing the blockchain and all our applications available. 

> **_NOTE:_** If you quit Thyra, the icon tray will disappear. Normal! If you want to add it back, open your finder and look for "thyra" in all your mac. You should see the following file "XXXX"; click on it and the app will be back on your top nav bar. 

> **_TROUBLESHOOTING:_** Do not hesitate to report any problem or request help by [opening an issue](https://github.com/massalabs/thyra/issues/new).
